This file contains the features I plan to implement for TODO application.

-There should be some input section to add new todos.
-Todos should be saved in the browser, so even though website gets refreshed, todos should be the same.
-Todos should be able to deleted and removed from the todo list.
-Todos components completed properties should be able to toggled.

-TodoList should have three choices to show which todos should be placed. One of them to show all of the todos,
one of them should show only completed todos, and the last one should show only todos that are not completed.

-Every todo component should have the text of the todo, two buttons, one of them for deleting the todo, the other for toggling
the completed property.

-Todo app should be styled well, maybe using css modules or, styled-components or some css framework.
-Code should be commented on every possible time.

-git changes should be committed with every little change.
-implement propTypes as much as possible.


-Firstly implement TodoApp's needs, later on add or change design, make it better. Use CSS, maybe some frameworks.
Make it look beautiful, and try to take this app seriously, even though it's seems little and unimportant.
